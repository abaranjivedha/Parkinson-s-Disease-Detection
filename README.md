# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
# Aim:
Create a UI where users can input relevant parameters, and the system predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's disease using a machine learning model.

# Description:
Design a user-friendly interface allowing users to input features like tremors, voice recordings, etc., for accurate disease detection.

# Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for developing the application.
Flask: Used to create the web application and handle routing.
Machine Learning: Employed a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.
HTML/CSS: For creating a user-friendly interface.
# Features
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple UI for inputting relevant parameters.
Real-Time Predictions: Provides immediate feedback on the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.
Visualization: Displays the result in a visually appealing manner.
